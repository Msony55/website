## About Me

I am an avid explorer interested in exploring as much as possible
about the field of exploring. You can often find me
exploring new and upcoming explorers, exploras and exploreded, while
at the same time deepening my knowledge in those that I have already
learnt. I am currently working with 5 of my friends, working on
projects together that will benefit the community.
